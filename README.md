# [Live demo](https://jsueling.github.io/threejs-portfolio)

A template 3D portfolio application that I developed in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I used [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) which combines all the benefits, including interactivity, of React with Three.js. It also offers many useful API's and abstractions that greatly simplifies developing complex scenes. I then used a premade Github Action to deploy the Next.js build to Github Pages.
