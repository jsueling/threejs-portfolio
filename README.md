[Live demo](https://jsueling.github.io/threejs-portfolio)

A frontend portfolio application I developed in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I used [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) to build a 3D portfolio which combines all the interactivity of React with Three.js. It has many useful API's and abstractions that greatly simplifies developing complex scenes.
